# fvGP - A Flexible multi-task GP engine

Welcome to the documentation of the fvGP API.
fvGP is a next-generation Gaussian (and Gaussian-related) process engine for flexible, domain-informed and 
HPC-ready stochastic function approximation. It is the backbone of the [gpCAM](https://gpcam.readthedocs.io) API.
The objective of fvGP is to take care of the mathematics behind GP training and predictions but allowing the user to have
maximum flexibilitiy in defining the GP.
