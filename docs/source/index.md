# fvGP - A Flexible multi-task GP engine

The [gpCAM](https://gpcam.readthedocs.io) API is upstream of fvGP which is the package providing everything around Gaussian Processes.
The package has its own [API](api/overview.md) which we present and explain in this documentation (IN PROGRESS).
Note, this is not really a full tutorial since fvGP is hardly ever being used directly,
all information provided here is just for the curious and advanced users.
