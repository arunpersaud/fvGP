# fvGP - A Flexible multi-task GP engine

The gpCAM API is upstream of fvGP which is the package providing everything around Gaussian Processes.
The package has its own API which we present and explain here (IN PROGRESS).
Note, this is not really a full tutorial since fvGP is hardly ever being used directly,
all information provided here is just for the curious and advanced users.
